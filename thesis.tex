% After that, check with 
%               fc-match Arial
% Use PDF figures!!! (for some reason EPS figures are not displayed correctly, 
% you can use 'epspdf myfigure.eps' to convert)

% Set packages 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\usepackage{lipsum} % for dummy text
\usepackage{todonotes} % for dummy image


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)
%\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
%\usepackage{amsmath}
%\usepackage{amsfonts}
%\usepackage{amssymb}
%\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage{subcaption}
%\usepackage{authblk}
%\usepackage{epsfig}
%\usepackage{mathtools}
%\usepackage{float}
%\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage[sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}



%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set font 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\ifxetexorluatex
   \usepackage{fontspec} % only use it with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, recommended. -- Shanhe
   \setmainfont{Arial}
\else
    % %%-- This is how to set Arial font using LaTeX or PdfLaTeX, not recommended. -- Shanhe
    % %% If you don't install the font into tex packages, then you will just get Computer Modern font.
    % %% How to install uarial package in Mac OS (required MacTeX, /Library/TeX/texbin in your path). *nix with TexLive should be similar. - Shanhe
    % %%   1. curl --remote-name https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
    % %%   2. sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
    % %%   3. sudo getnonfreefonts --sys -a
    % %% Then uncommen the following two lines.
    %\usepackage{uarial}
    %\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
\fi


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set indent 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% The wmthesis class is based on the latex report class which
% only indents paragraphs if they immediately follow other paragraphs.  The
% dissertation lady says this is wrong.  I tend to give more credence
% to Dr. Knuth (author of TeX) on this issue, since the other way looks really
% crappy.  If you want the first line of every paragraph indented,
% uncomment the next line to include the indentfirst package. -- rem
% Not sure if this is still an option -- Ruth
% Not an issue any more, but I keep this line in case -- Shanhe
% \usepackage{indentfirst}
%%Hyperref works best as the last package
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true, %%false = box, true = text color
    linkcolor=blue,
    filecolor=magenta,      
    urlcolor=cyan,
    pdftitle={Overleaf Example},
    pdfpagemode=FullScreen,
    }

%% Only necessary for draft mode, once final should not need directly below anymore    
\hypersetup{final}

%        sets both \thesis@author and \ thesis@authorx to
%        "A. Goode Student"
%     \thesisAuthor[Aloysius Goode Student]{A. Goode Student}
